## Questions to answer before release

- How are we keeping this website running a blog as well as the Snowledge blog? is the written content differentiated? I don't think so but is it also going to overwhelm the Snowledge blog if we are posting atleast monthly or is it going to miss some things?
- How are we breaking down giveaways to premium backers and what do they get the chance to win
- I need Eric and Zook to also work on these pages
- how much do we need to spend to be getting 1,000 views on each of the monthly pieces of content, those will hopefully continue to build over the winter
- use of photos in this design
